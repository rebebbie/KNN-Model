# KNN-Model
Making a KNN model in Python, tested on the Iris dataset from sklearn.

Since the accuracy of KNN is heavily reliant on the hyperparameter K, I tested with values 5, 10, and 50 to see which ones return a high accuracy (A.K.A. low error) result. 

Here is the dataset: 
![KNN](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9741bd3c-8a7d-4ec3-a1d2-b17afcfd480f)

When we predict using K=5, accuracy score is 97%

When we predict using K=10, accuracy score is 100%

When we predict using K=50, accuracy score is 93%
