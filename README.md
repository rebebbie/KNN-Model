# KNN-Model
Making a KNN model in Python, tested on the Iris dataset from sklearn.

Since the accuracy of KNN is heavily reliant on the hyperparameter K, I tested with values 5, 10, and 50 to see which ones return a high accuracy (A.K.A. low error) result. 

For K=5:
Accuracy score is 97%

For K=10:
Accuracy score is 100%

For K=50:
Accuracy score is 93%
